***********************************************
Testing the server using browser:

- The server works perfectly with browsers for any number of users!
- It will set a cookie which the browser will return.
- If you try to login multiple users in the same browser, the user logged in most recently will be accredited. Because of 
  the use of non persistent connection by the given python client, lack of details, and time constraints,
  this loophole should be reasonable!
- If you open multiple users using multiple browsers, everything will run smoothly.

************************************************
Testing the server using python clients:

- The clients do not provide any cookie headers, so this testing method is unfair, and should not be used!
